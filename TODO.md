# Large TODOs
- Pursuit Level AI (use % angle between 0.00 and 1.00)
- Lag spikes on level editor when editing a largely sized (50+?) campaign.
- Multiplayer pings on the map
- Bonus life! animation
- Level editor auto-save
- Achievements UI
- Mod API upgrade
- POTENTIALLY enhance the single player campaign selection menu.
- Migrate to a new, more flexible, and more easily accessible UI system (I really don't want to do this but I have to...)

## Smaller TODOs
- Fix XP sometimes being NaN
- Lantern for each player in lantern mode
- Fix text shadow being too distant on large display resolutions
- Missions themselves have the property of "Extra life" instead of the campaign.
