# Large TODOs
- Pursuit Level AI (use % angle between 0.00 and 1.00)... kinda done
- Lag spikes on level editor when editing a largely sized (50+?) campaign... fixed?
- Multiplayer pings on the map... done
- Bonus life! animation
- Level editor auto-save
- Achievements UI... done, mostly
- Mod API upgrade... done
- POTENTIALLY enhance the single player campaign selection menu.
- Migrate to a new, more flexible, and more easily accessible UI system (I really don't want to do this but I have to...)
- Make tanks have a physics body circle that extends outside of the tank to determine the "preferred distance" they have from obstacles.
	- This mechanic could also serve as a way for the tank to not place mines when near something

## Smaller TODOs
- Fix XP sometimes being NaN... done
- Lantern for each player in lantern mode
- Fix text shadow being too distant on large display resolutions... done
- Missions themselves have the property of "Extra life" instead of the campaign.
