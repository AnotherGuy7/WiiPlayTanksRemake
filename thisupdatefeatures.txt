This update brings a handful of changes to modding capabilities, the game itself, and many great fixes that people have complained about.

Remember you can enable speedrun mode with `F1`! Top 5 uploaded (may be changed later) speedruns will get their spot on the main menu!

## Additions

- No content additions! But additions to the modding capabilities have been made plenty.

## Changes

- "Third person" mode is now "POV" mode (first person).
- Bullet tracking UI is now white for unused bullets

## Source Code Changes (for modders)

- `ITankHurtContext`s' properties have been streamlined
- `Explosion.Source` -> `Explosion.Owner`
- Added new `ModShell` and `ModBlock` for more extensive modding capabilities!

## Fixes

- Z-fighting on tank shadows no longer occurs
- Fixed campaign prematurely ending when the player had 1 life remaining sometimes
- Fix modding crashes related to adding and removing content
- Fix addition/removal of modded tanks within the level editor due to missing declarations for the modded tank
- Fix animation bleeding when exiting missions/campaigns

## TODO

- [ ] Bonus life screen
- [ ] Overhaul the multiplayer lobby screen
- [ ] Math operations optimization
- [ ] New AI tank aggression system (depending on the tank type, will either make advances towards you or will avoid you)

Happy tanking!
