Sorry, been a while. Got caught up in stuff... Anyway, finally another update!

Remember you can enable speedrun mode with `F1`! Top 5 uploaded (may be changed later) speedruns will get their spot on the main menu!

## Additions



## Changes

- Made stats screen good-er...?
- Chat box now shows messages from the bottom up, and text is properly scaled now.
- Made tracks more closely packed together.

## Source Code Changes (for modders)



## Fixes

- Fixed AI companion bug
- Fixed tank tracks not being placed during tank rotation

## TODO

- [ ] Bonus life screen
- [ ] Overhaul the multiplayer lobby screen
- [ ] Math operations optimization
- [ ] Level Editor bug fixes (rotation bug, etc.)
	- Re-entering the level editor from testing will now no longer flip the tanks around the Y-axis.
- [ ] New AI tank aggression system (depending on the tank type, will either make advances towards you or will avoid you)


PLEASE, if you find anything wrong, go to my [discord](https://discord.gg/KhfzvbrrKx) server and report bugs in the #bugs 
channel, or, if you want to suggest something, suggest them in the #suggestions channel.

Happy tanking!
