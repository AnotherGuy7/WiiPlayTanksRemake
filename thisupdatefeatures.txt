This update fixes a plethora of bugs and problems, alongside some new cool content and a lot of good visual changes

Remember you can enable speedrun mode with `F1`! Top 5 uploaded (may be changed later) speedruns will get their spot on the main menu!

## Additions

- New 'Air Support' gamemode!
- New interactive logo!
- In-game missions now have their own names attributed to them, for fanciness.
    - You can still see what mission number you are on

## Changes

- New game icon
- Smoke is now 3D in first person mode
- If launched in Debug, the game will supply the user with a console
- Explosions don't sound super low pitched by default anymore
- Explosions rotate 2x faster
- Revamped mission info bar
- Player tank no longer struggles to move around when using keyboard
- Missions added to the campaign list are now named what # mission they are in the entire campaign
    - Players must delete and re-install the Vanilla campaign for the changes to appear
- Some missions have had re-arranged player spawns for multiplayer

## Changes Important for Modders

- Many renames but not any move-arounds
- De-obfuscated AI Tank functions under the hood, as it now has many more methods to differentiate their thought process
- Debug enable has been changed to F4, and debug level decrease/increase have been changed to F5/F6 respectively
- `MapRenderer` -> `GameSceneRenderer`

## Fixes

- Game now loads much faster

- Fix finnicky campaign saving
    - This means that players who have made their own campaigns need to update for the new fixes

- Testing missions no causes strange things to happen to tanks
- Level editor placement/removal actions are no longer possible when changing the properties
- Fix Z-fighting/overlap with tank shadows
- Harsh black shadowing on the bottom-right of the map is no longer harsh
- Returning from level test now properly highlights which level you tested after testing is done
- Fix homing shells targeting dead tanks
- Tanks no longer freeze randomized movement while firing shells
- Tanks should trap themselves almost never now

## TODO

- [ ] Bonus life screen
- [ ] Overhaul the multiplayer lobby screen
- [ ] Math operations optimization
- [ ] New AI tank aggression system (depending on the tank type, will either make advances towards you or will avoid you)
