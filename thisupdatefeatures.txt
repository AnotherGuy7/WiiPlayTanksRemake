Sorry, been a while. Got caught up in stuff... Anyway, finally another update!

Remember you can enable speedrun mode with `F1`! Top 5 uploaded (may be changed later) speedruns will get their spot on the main menu!

## Additions

- Achievements you unlock will appear at the top of your screen when unlocked!
- New AI tank aggression system (depending on the tank type, will either make advances towards you or will avoid you)
- New smoke grenades difficulty.
- New player callouts system!
	-Use the numbers at the top of your keyboard to make pings, choosing from (in ascending order):
		- General
		- Stay
		- Watch
		- Avoid
		- Go To
		- Focus
		- Group up

## Changes

- Made the mission display show what number mission you're on, to know how many you have left/what mission you're on (numerically)
- Re-hauled the multiplayer lobby screen.
- The game now uses .NET 8.0, which means there will be performance improvements around the board.
- Largely overhauled enemy AI, including changes to:
	- The pathing system (tanks now prefer exploration instead of wandering in circles endlessly)
	- The shooting system (tanks now shoot at walls with a tank on the other side much less often)
	- Mine laying system (tanks will trap themselves with mines LESS OFTEN)
	- Shell avoidance system (tanks will now only avoid shells if the shell is heading in their direction)

## Fixes

- Re-entering the level editor from testing will now no longer flip the tanks around the Y-axis.
- Fixed level editor warnings disappearing fast on high refresh rates.

## TODO

- [ ] Bonus life screen
- [ ] Overhaul the multiplayer lobby screen
- [ ] Math operations optimization

Happy tanking!
