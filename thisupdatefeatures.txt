## Changes Important for Modders

	- This includes `GameView` and `GameProjection`, important matrices to include with custom 3D rendering involving gameplay
- `GamepadBind` and `Keybind` now are `IInputBind<T>`s, which means you can use use them modularly within your code
- When changing tank models, be sure to set `UsesCustomModel` to `true`
- Assets (only models, for now) are managed via `Resource<Model>`s within `ModelResources`.
- Particles now rotate on the proper Yaw-Pitch-Roll axes, conversion:
	- Old Yaw -> Roll
	- Old Pitch -> Yaw
	- Old Roll -> Pitch
- `TankGame.PostDraw` -> `TankGame.PostDrawEverything`
- Numerous rendering-related things are now stored in `RenderGlobals`

- `GameHandler.GameRand` -> `Client.ClientRandom`

## Fixes

- Pause UI now appears over everything
- Citrine Tank Music now is prioritized over Ruby
- Optimized various mathematical operations around the code, making things a bit more performant
- Level editor now properly displays the correct mission name on the info bar
- Fixed crash involving deleting the first mission of a campaign
- Enabling "Lantern Mode" no longer makes the main menu blur go away

- Fixed game not properly retrieving hardware information

## TODO

- [ ] Bonus life screen
- [ ] New AI tank aggression system (depending on the tank type, will either make advances towards you or will avoid you)
